### Key ideas
1. Why this is useful?
    - Fake news can cause a lot of social and economical damage
    - e.g. https://www.ted.com/talks/stephanie_busari_how_fake_news_does_real_harm/discussion?CMP=
    - https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/fake-news-can-cause-irreversible-damage-companies-sink-their-stock-n995436

    - The trend is rising for fake news creation. With the rise of DeepFake (Generator AI) etc., anyone can create fake content and spread them. (show example of obama speech)

    - Imaginary example to link to COVID-19
    - Someone spread that certain area is opened up and no longer has lockdown or MCO (may increase infection rate). Or food supplies in the country has ran out (may cause widespread panic)
    - Get statistics on the economical and social cost PER DAY of lockdown.
    - Expert prediction on opening up too early and its cost?

2. Key audience
    - Government
    - Social media company

3. The future plan
    - To create a bot to flag potential fake news
    - To quickly allow user to verify any messages (be it in whatsapp) via a quick few taps (first download the app)
    - Once users started using this, the search keywords/images/audios can be tracked. When there's a spike of same keywords/images/audios, we know this piece of information is trending and spreading. Then, it's imperative to get first hand clarification from authorities/companies/parties involved. Hence, we can get government/companies to join into this platform, and this platform will notify the parties involved, so that they can clarify on any misinformation that are spreading out there ASAP.

4. Expansion plan
    - Domestically, cover more categories of news. Applicable beyond COVID-19
    - Worldwide, cover news from different countries.
