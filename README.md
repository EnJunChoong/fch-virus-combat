### Crude Idea
1. Scrap news from various sources, and label their authenticity as True (authentic news) or False (fake news).
2. Labelling of the news authenticity can be inferred from a manually curated list of credible sources and official sources like sebenar.my.
3. Store the news and labels on a database.
4. Create an API to allow developers to query the database. Use case include development of web/mobile apps to tackle fake news, model training for fake news detection, and bots to help detect fake news.

### Start Small, Think Big, Scale Fast
1. Start Small: Work on Malaysia news sources, create a database and API only.
2. Think Big: Aim to create a bot to automatically detect potential fake news, enlighten any potential readers with an automated reply to the news (on Twitter for now). E.g. someone posted a fake news on Twitter, a bot will detect it and reply to the tweet, suggesting that it is a fake news, and cite at least one credible source to enlighten any potential reader.
3. Scale Fast: Scale to other countries, scrap news from various countries, and make the bot an international one.
